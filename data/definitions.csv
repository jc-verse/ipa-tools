Name,Abbr,Description,Consists of
Syllabic,syl,forms a syllable peak (and thus can be stressed).,vowels
Sonorant,son,sounds produced with a vocal tract configuration in which spontaneous voicing is possible.,vowels + nasals + glides + liquids
Consonantal,cons,sounds produced with a major obstruction in the oral cavity.,obstruents + nasals + liquids - laryngeals ([h] + [ʔ])
Continuant,cont,the primary constriction is not narrowed so much that airflow through the oral cavity is blocked.,vowels + glides + fricatives
Delayed release,del.rel,release of a total constriction is slowed so that a fricative is formed after the stop portion.,affricates
Nasal,nas,the velum is lowered which allows air to escape through the nose.,nasals
Lateral,lat,the mid section of the tongue is lowered at the side.,laterals
Spread glottis,s.g.,the vocal folds are spread far apart.,aspirated obstruents + breathy sonorants
Constricted glottis,c.g.,the vocal folds are tightly constricted.,implosives + ejectives + laryngealized sonorants
Voice,voi,the vocal folds vibrate.,voiced (- ejectives + implosives)
Coronal,cor,produced with the blade or tip of the tongue raised from the neutral position.,dentals + alveolars + palatals + retroflexes
Anterior,ant,produced with a major constriction located at or in front of the alveolar ridge.,labials + labiodentals + dentals + alveolars ([s] vs. [ʃ])
Strident,strident,produced with greater noisiness.,labials vs. labiodentals; dentals vs. alveolars
Distributed,distr,produced with a constriction that extends for a considerable distance along the direction of airflow.,blade ("laminal") vs. tip ("apical") ⊆ coronal; dentals
High,high,the body of the tongue is raised from the neutral position.,high vowels + palatals + velars
Low,low,the body of the tongue is lowered from the neutral position.,low vowels + pharyngeals
Back,back,the body of the tongue is retracted from the neutral position.,central vowels + back vowels + velars + uvulars + pharyngeals
Round,round,the lips are protruded.,
Tense,tense,"sounds requiring deliberate, accurate, maximally distinct gestures that involve considerable muscular effort.",
Advanced tongue root,ATR,produced by drawing the root of the tongue forward.,
